However, in my experience these are often databases that are well managed and accessible already so often the API work loses potency from actual application after training.   This shouldn't deter us as API usage and being a standard way of accessing data is on the rise across government and in the NHS.  In paricular, NHSX should be leading on the call for more accessible data through APIs and so understanding how to build and use these is important.  \n",
